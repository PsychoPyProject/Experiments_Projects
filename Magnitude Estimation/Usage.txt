Usage Magnitude Estimation ver1.2

In this program,
you can compare frequency of standard vibration and the frequency of stimulate vibration
and estimate the frequency of stimulate vibration.

**How to use**
ÅEdownload ver 1.2 folder
ÅEopen untitled4.psyexp in ver 1.2

**process**

1.The standerd vibration is provibed.
If you can remenber it,press Space key.

2.The stimulate vibration is provibed.(3sec)

3.You can estimate frequency of stimulate vibration by using number key(not Ten key).
  You can use "q" key to delete the number.
  If you deside, press Enter and go to next trial.

Repeat 2 and 3.

**Experimental condition**

In standard_sound.xlsx
standerd_sound....This parameter shows name of file that is standard vibration.
volume_2..........This parameter shows volume of standard vibration and standard vibration.

In experiment3.xlsx, experimental condition is described.

**parameters

sound_file........This parameter shows name of file that is stimulate vibration.
volume_1..........This parameter shows volume of stimulate vibration and standard vibration.
